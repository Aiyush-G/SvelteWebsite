Not documented EVERYTHING here, just notes for me to look back on. 
Trying to understand how array prototype methods work in JS

# Notes

issue with arrays identified as how SVELTE deals with REACTIVITY

spread operator is ...

1. You have an initial array:
   ```javascript
   let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
   ```

2. You then use the `push` method to add a new element to the array:
   ```javascript
   numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);
   ```

Here's what happens in detail:

- `numbers.length` returns the current length of the array, which is 6.
- You add 1 to this length, resulting in 7.
- `push` then adds this new element (7) to the end of the array.

After this operation, the array should be:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

However, if you see an empty item and a skipped number, it might be due to a different issue or a misunderstanding of the initial state of the array. Here are a few things to check:

1. **Initial State of the Array**: Ensure the initial array is indeed `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
2. **Other Operations**: Verify that there are no other operations modifying the array between the initialization and the `push` call.
3. **Output/Logging**: Print the array before and after the `push` operation to see the exact changes.

Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate the correct behavior:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(numbers);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);
console.log(numbers);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```
