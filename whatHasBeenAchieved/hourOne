Install Node

Learn how to use the terminal 
Start a SVELTE project via CLI

- I attmpted to donwload NODE via CLI, couldn't get it to work.... then attempted using a pre-built package manager
- node -v works WOOOP
- took ages to figure out how to access the repo remotely via terminal
- realised cannot use physical file system via remote repo
- installed GIT locally - `brew install git`
- had to first install BREW - `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

- managed to finally create a skeleton project:
```
npm create svelte@latest myapp
cd myapp
npm install
npm run dev
```

NOTES;
```
# installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
# download and install Node.js (you may need to restart the terminal)
nvm install 20
# verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
node -v # should print `v20.15.0`
# verifies the right NPM version is in the environment
npm -v # should print `10.7.0`
```

```
npm create svelte@latest myapp
```
